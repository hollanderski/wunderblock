# Wunderblock
webGL interface for "Wunderblock", art installation exhibited at PHITECO 2022


<br>

Created by Ninon Lizé Masclef and Syd Reynal, the installation Wunderblock proposes a reflection on telepresence and the ambivalence it carries through the oppositions presence-absence, virtual-embodied, simultaneity-latency. Wunderblock mediates the touch, through a tension between organic traces embedded in the material of a tactile sensor and digital traces reincarnated in the flesh of the virtual world.
As it breaks the simultaneity traditionally at work in the real-time human-machine interface, Wunderblock opens up power of the après-coup. From traces on the walls of Lascaux to the prophylaxis of the Metaverse, this work thus questions the multiplicity of modes of collective presence and forms of memories that materialize there.


The installation was exhibited during the seminar PHITECO (Philosophy Technology Cognition) 2022 at University of Technology of Compiègne whose theme was : "Technical mediation of presence".
